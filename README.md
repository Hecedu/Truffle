# Truffle!

Truffle is a client for the Wayback Machine by archive.org
My main objective is to streamline the user experience that archive.org offers and at the same time make it more inmersive by creating a frontend search browser that mimics web design trends accross different time periods.

## Upcoming features

You'll see :)
